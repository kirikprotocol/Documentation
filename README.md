### Calling MiniApps Plugins

In MiniApps a plugin (a.k.a. template, gadget) is a separate component of the platform that adds functionality when connected to a service. There are plugins constituting an integral part of the platform (built-in plugins), as well as third-party plugins developed by independent programmers. The latter can be developed using the MiniApps capabilities, or external tools.

Three methods of plugin calls are available at present.

1. Specifying attributes of a page, or a page element.
Examples: MSISDN verification with the use of  "msisdn-required" page attribute, or entry of Telegram password when specifying the type of an entry field.
2. Following a link with a special protocol.
Example: going to the MSISDN verification plugin using the verify://msisdn link.
3. Following a link to a miniapps.run platform built-in plugin using a specially formed HTTP address.

The first two methods are described in [MSISDN verification](https://github.com/kirikprotocol/MSISDN-verification-plugin).

#### HTTP Notation for Plugin Calls

A plugin is called by following a link of a special format. The link is formed based on:

- Plugin identifier. 
Every plugin identifier is unique and does not depend on a particular MiniApps unit.

- Parameters transmitted. 
The set of supported parameters is plugin specific.

This link is a correct HTTP URL and has the following format. Access to this address is not guaranteed, neither the address is requested from MiniApps when following the link - handling of addresses on plugins.miniapps.run is done locally.
```
http://plugins.miniapps.run/<PLUGIN_ID>?param1=value1&param2=value2&param3=value3
```
Where:

- http://plugins.miniapps.run is the mandatory constant prefix;
- PLUGIN_ID - plugin identifier;
- The arguments are transferred as regular query parameters.

Example:
```
<navigation>
  <link pageId="http://plugins.miniapps.run/msisdn-verification?type=c2s&success_url=private.jsp">
    Go to page
  </link>
</navigation>
```

#### Supported Plugins

The set of supported plugins is determined in the MiniApps settings.
